The following is Anoop's paper on pose estimation in videos using HoG features
and a simple graphical model.

The following papers are on deep learning for pose detection in single frames.
Both were recommended by Anoop (2015-07-24).

The next few papers are all related to clothing parsing, and each use Yang and
Ramanan's pose estimator in some way

The next paper is about comparing action recognition with pose estimation to
action recognition with lower-level features. It has a stupid title, but the
answer is "yes, it does".

  booktitle={BMVC},

This next paper is about using pose estimation to recognise inanimate objects
which people interact with (e.g. chairs, carpets, computer desks, etc.)
@incollection{delaitre2012scene,
  title={Scene semantics from long-term observation of people},
